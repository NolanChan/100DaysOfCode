S-99: Ninety-Nine Problems in Scala + #100DaysOfCode Challenge Journal
------------

Inspired by [Alexander Kallaway's #100DaysOfCode Challenge](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/start-2017-with-the-100daysofcode-improved-and-updated-18ce604b237b#.qv02ziw4a), I want to commit to progressively working on the 99 Problems, Scala Edition for 99 days. I've been taught that any good New Years Resolution (or resolution in general) will ultimately fail unless you make it MEASUREABLE. And taking this equation from AMP conference writer Sarah Chan:

_GOAL + DO + WHEN = MEASURABLE GOAL_

So for the next 99 days, my _goal_ will be to work on the 99 Problems in Scala for at least 30 minutes a day. Each problem ranges in difficulty, and I don't think I can expect to finish each one in one day's time. But I'll devote 30 minutes to coding with Github being my bookkeeper. Unlike the original #100DaysOfCode, since I'm trying to learn Scala from scratch, I won't be able to start on any projects at first. Yet by at least day 45, I should be on the look out for projects I can contribute to. 

I'll also be updating this readme with a log/journal on my progress:

###Journal

####Day 1: January 5th, 2017 
My initial commitment to this challenge. I uploaded my first 3 problems in Scala. Extremely trivial problems, but they're great excuses for me to look through the Scala Documentation!

####Day 2+3: January 6th + 7th, 2017
Worked extra long to make up for both days. Though I got thorugh only 4 and 5, it was good practice to try different methods in obtaining the solution (built in, recursive, tail recursive, functional)

####Day 4: January 8th, 2017
_Today's Progress_: Instead of working on a few Scala problems, I finished up a long overdue PR and started another for Lale.

_Takeaway_: I feel like I'm learning HTML and CSS from near scratch again (and again, and again...) but projects like these help me put front-end development into a concrete application, even if it's simplistic.

####Day 5: January 9th, 2017
_Today's Progress_: ~~I can't believe I spent the past 50 minutes just trying to figure out how make cases work for problem #7 while making pretty much zero progress. I probably should have recorded my iterations to remember what I had done. I can't seem figure out how to match for a list inside a list~~
The final 10 minutes were the breakthrough that I was hoping for, but mostly because I found out that ++: preserved the List type that I wanted. I'm glad that the logic came all together though for the recursive solution. The FlatMap solution presented is much cleaner, albeit I never would have known about the functionality if I didn't see it.

_Takeaway_: It's discouraging to be stuck on such simple a task at the start of learning a new language, but learning anything new never comes easy

####Day 6: January 11th, 2017
_Today's Progress_: Was feeling lazy yesterday, so I didn't work on some problems. Thinking back, I really regret it. Today, I started reading Scala for the Impatient and got through about 11 pages. It's good to read about the basics, RichInt, StringOps, everything being an object, when I don't need a return type (non-recursive functions), types of for loops, etc. 
I also started and finished the first week of homework for the online Scala Coursera course. I felt that substituted for about a day or two of work.

_Takeaway_: There's so many resources on Scala! It's just a matter of diligence and not getting bored/discouraged.

####Day 7: January 12th, 2017
_Today's Progress_: I was pretty stuck with P08 because I was unfamiliar with Scala's match syntax and got a lot of false positives. However, I finished it by adding in a few extra match cases. Not the most efficient in terms of recrusion, but it's a learning process.

_Takeaway_: Don't be afraid to comment out wrong methods so I can leave mistakes for posterity's sake

####Day 8: January 14th, 2017
_Today's Progress_: Skipped the 13th because of a busy day down in Torrance. Today, I reviewed the binary search algorithm and an additional problem. Also included tests with Python's unittest module!

_Takeaway_: Common algorithms can be deceptively complex. Practice, practice, practice!
