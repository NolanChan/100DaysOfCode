S-99: Ninety-Nine Problems in Scala
------------

Inspired by [Alexander Kallaway's #100DaysOfCode Challenge](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/start-2017-with-the-100daysofcode-improved-and-updated-18ce604b237b#.qv02ziw4a), I want to commit to progressively working on the 99 Problems, Scala Edition. I've been taught that any good New Years Resolution (or resolution in general) will ultimately fail unless you make it MEASUREABLE. And taking this equation from AMP conference writer Sarah Chan:

_GOAL + DO + WHEN = MEASURABLE GOAL_

So for the next 99 days, my *goal* will be to work on the 99 Problems in Scala for at least 30 minutes a day. Each problem ranges in difficulty, and I don't think I can expect to finish each one in one day's time. But I willat least work 30 minutes on each problem with Github being my bookkeeper. Unlike the original #100DaysOfCode, since I'm trying to learn Scala from scratch, I won't be able to start on any projects at first. Yet by at least day 45, I should be on the look out for projects I can contribute to. 

I'll also be updating this readme with a log/journal on my progress:

###Journal

Day 1: 1/5/2017 - My initial commitment to this challenge. I uploaded my first 3 problems in Scala. Extremely trivial problems, but they're great excuses for me to look through the Scala Documentation!

Day 2+3: Worked extra long to make up for both days. Though I got thorugh only 4 and 5, it was good practice to try different methods in obtaining the solution (built in, recursive, tail recursive, functional)
